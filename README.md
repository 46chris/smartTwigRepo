### Some notes 
Made with MERN stack 

Client: 
- Components: 
    - Player.js: Didn't end up being used 
    - Start.js: This is the start screen. Here, users can enter new names or choose from existing ones 
    that are stored in the database
    - Game.js: This handles all of the game logic for individual games (1 v 1) and for the entire tournament. 

Server: 
- The only thing that was stored in the database were new names. All of the winner and leaderboard logic is in the 
frontend
